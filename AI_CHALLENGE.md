# AI Usage Assessment

## Context

The use of AI tools (such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) is increasingly common in day-to-day development. We want to understand how you would integrate these tools into your workflow.

## Task

Choose **one** of the tasks from the technical challenge and describe how you would use an AI tool to assist with the implementation. Answer the questions below in a short paragraph each (no need to be extensive).

### Questions

1. **Which task did you choose and which AI tool would you use?**
   - Example: "Task 2 (ManifestsController) using GitHub Copilot in VS Code"

2. **How would you formulate the prompt or use the tool?**
   - Describe the prompt you would give or how you would configure the tool
   - What context would you provide (reference files, documentation, etc.)?

3. **What would you review in the AI-generated code?**
   - What types of problems would you expect to find?
   - How would you validate that the code is correct?

4. **What are the limits of AI usage in this type of task?**
   - In which scenarios does AI help the most? In which does it help the least?
   - When would you prefer to write the code manually?

## Format

Write your answers directly in this file, below each question. There is no right or wrong answer - we want to understand your reasoning and critical thinking about the use of these tools.
